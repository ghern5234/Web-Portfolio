# Web-Portfolio


## Description

- The motivation behind this project was to create a web portfolio from scratch, highlighting our achievments so far. We were to use only HTML and CSS, and design the application to be responsive. 
- It solves the issue of not having a way to show case to employers our best selves.
- Working on this project has shown me the importance of structuring your code effectively from the beginning. Taking time to lay out your application will help to ensure a smooth styling process. It has also showed me the power of tools such as media queries and pseudo elements. 

- This project was a great first attempting at building something from complete scratch, and was a huge learning opportunity. It might not be exactly how I want it, but I learned a lot and will definitely be making edits and updates as I learn more in the course.
