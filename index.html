        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="aboutMe">
          Hello there! My name is George Hernandez, a 31-year-old licensed
          massage therapist with a passion for making the transition to software
          development. Originally from San Antonio, I made the exciting move to
          Austin back in 2010. Outside of work, you'll often find me indulging
          in a variety of hobbies. I'm an avid player of both tennis and
          pickleball, constantly seeking to improve my game. I prioritize my
          fitness by hitting the gym regularly and enjoy any opportunity to be
          in or around water. Gaming and watching anime also hold special places
          in my heart, and I'm always up for an adventure. Whether it's
          exploring a new city or hitting the slopes! I'm a proud father of two
          pugs and a French bulldog, each equiped with ridiculous personalities.
          Compassion, honesty, and respect serve as guiding principles in both
          my personal and professional life. I firmly believe in treating others
          with the kindness and dignity they deserve, while staying true to
          oneself. One of my greatest strengths lies in my communication skills
          and my knack for quickly grasping new concepts. These qualities make
          me confident that I would be an asset to any team or company.
        </p>
        <p class="aboutMe">
          My journey towards software development really began after an untimely
          gym injury, and being forced to take a lot of down time. Determined
          not waste it, I began to reconsider the longevity of body work, and
          made the decision to look for something less physical. Going off my
          observation of the tech boom and my own prior knowledge from gaming, I
          decided to explore onliine computer courses and stumbled upon coding.
          After immersing myself in a few free Python tutorials, I found myself
          hooked. The thrill of learning something new and the sense of
          challenge it brought really reaffirmed my decision to pursue it
          further. I embarked on this new chapter and have enrolled in the UT
          coding bootcamp. Though in the beginning stages, I am finding myself
          being challenged like never before. However this has only sharpened my
          determination to pursue my newfound passion for software development,
          as well as reminded me I can do anything I put my mind too. I am eager
          to bring my unique blend of skills, experiences, and enthusiasm to the
          world of technology, and I can't wait to see where this journey takes
          me.

            This project represents my inaugural task within the Fullstack
            Developer Bootcamp curriculum. Its primary objective was to serve as
            a repository for critical knowledge acquired during the initial
            phase of the course. Constructed predominantly utilizing CSS and
            HTML, with supplementary application of introductory JavaScript, the
            assignment assisted with our comprehension of browser console
            utilization and proficiency with developer tools.

            This project represents the second task within our course
            curriculum, code refactoring to enhance a codebase. The task
            entailed implementing improvements to ensure greater accessibility,
            thereby emphasizing the significance of writing clear and accessible
            code. Through this exercise, we gained valuable insights into
            debugging techniques and further honed our skills with developer
            tools.
